# iPhone Clone Site

Welcome to the iPhone Clone Site project! This repository contains a meticulously designed clone of the iPhone website, built as a hands-on learning exercise to explore modern front-end development tools and libraries. This project focuses on mastering Tailwind CSS, Vite, TypeScript, and React, with a special emphasis on using GSAP for creating smooth 3D animations.

## Project Goals

1. **Learn Tailwind CSS**

   - Explore the utility-first CSS framework to rapidly design and style the site.
   - Gain experience with customizing themes and components.

2. **Master Vite**

   - Understand how Vite provides a fast and efficient development environment.
   - Leverage its modern build tools for optimized production builds.

3. **Strengthen TypeScript Skills**

   - Implement strong typing to reduce bugs and improve code maintainability.
   - Work with advanced TypeScript features in a React project.

4. **Deep Dive into React**

   - Build reusable components for a scalable architecture.
   - Manage application state and routing effectively.

5. **Experiment with GSAP**
   - Integrate GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create dynamic 3D animations.
   - Use GSAP's ScrollTrigger for interactive effects.
